                <p>Jack's Self Serve Car Wash carries a legacy that began in 1973, when it first opened its doors to the Huntington Beach community as <strong>EZ Car Wash</strong>. The original vision was simple: make car care quick, affordable, and accessible for everyone. Customers could soap, brush, rinse, and go—all in just a few minutes and for a few dollars.</p>
                <p>As the demand for better equipment and a more refined experience grew, EZ Car Wash evolved. In 2014, it was upgraded and renamed <strong>U Wash Car Wash</strong>, offering improved water pressure, better soap delivery systems, and a cleaner, more reliable washing experience. This remodel helped usher in a new era of self-serve convenience for car enthusiasts and everyday drivers alike.</p>

                <p>Now, in honor of the original founder Jack, the facility has once again been transformed—reborn as <strong>Jack's Self Serve Car Wash</strong>. With a completely modernized layout, the car wash now features high-walled bays to reduce overspray and give each visitor a sense of privacy while they clean.</p>
                <p>The intuitive dial-based control system lets you switch between features like foam brush, high-pressure rinse, and spot-free rinse at your own pace—delivering an easy, effective clean every time.</p>

            <div class="section-text">
                <p>What truly sets Jack's apart is the water quality. The car wash utilizes a soft water double reverse osmosis (RO) system, engineered for a much larger facility, to ensure the cleanest and purest water reaches your car.</p>
                <p>The result? Fewer spots, a clearer finish, and less need for hand drying afterward. It’s this kind of extra detail that keeps long-time locals coming back.</p>

                <p>Whether you're paying by card or coin, you’ll find the process effortless. Credit card acceptors take tap, slide, or phone payments. Once accepted, your bay activates and starts the timer—just $1 to start and $1 per minute after that.</p>
                <p>Cash customers are equally welcome. Bays accept quarters and dollar coins, and change machines on site dispense dollar coins for convenience.</p>

                <p>Jack's Car Wash isn't just about clean cars—it's about maintaining a piece of Huntington Beach history. From the early days of EZ Car Wash to today, the mission remains the same: keep things simple, affordable, and high-quality for every customer.</p>
